# HeliumWeatherDataColletion

## The Goals:
-  Collect data on the way the weather affects signal propigation on the helium network.
-  Have a way to generate a really cool graph of the data.

## My hypothesis:
I think that the network will preform differently in different weather conditions. To test this this program records data about the weather condition("Temp", "Clear/Fog/Windy/etc.",persipitation)
This data is stored in the testing.txt file in the format
(Timestamp)&(temp)&(weather description)&(timestamp of wittness)&(gain)

## Next steps
After I have collected enough data I will write and publish a script to turn the data into a cool graph to see if there is a coralation.
